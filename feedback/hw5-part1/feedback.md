### Design: 3/3

- Nice interface design!

- Since Node.java is basically just serving as a wrapper class for a String type at the moment, it becomes a bit redundant as a regular String would essentially have the same functionality.

### Documentation & Specification (including JavaDoc): 3/3

### Testing (test suite quality & implementation): 3/3

### Code quality (code stubs/skeletons only, nothing else): 1/3

- You included some implementation details. These may include private methods,
private inner classes, private fields, abstraction functions, and representation
invariants.

### Mechanics: 3/3

#### Overall Feedback

- Excellent design and testing overall, but make sure to follow the spec and not include implementation details (those are for HW5-pt2).

#### More Details

None.
