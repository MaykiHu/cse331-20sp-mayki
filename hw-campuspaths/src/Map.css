NOTE: This file is designed to help you just get a simple canvas with the correct
settings, centered on the screen. If you'd like to modify this, you're totally
welcome to do so. This is just to help you get something simple working first.

/*
This makes all <canvas> elements fill 90% of the width of whatever they're inside.
We deliberately do not set the height here too - when we set canvas.width
and canvas.height in Map.tsx, this 90% helps keep the canvas from being too big,
but not setting the height means the image keeps the correct aspect ratio (it'll be set
automatically to the correct thing).
