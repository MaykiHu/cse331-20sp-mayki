created graph graph1

#Add three non-same nodes to the graph
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

#Add a pair of edges with the same parent to the graph
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1

#Lists what is the toString() of this graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
the children of n3 in graph1 are:
